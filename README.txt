This game has been made during the StopWaitingForGodot game jam created by Terry Cavanagh

This is just a simple fps since the theme was "keep it simple"

I already got some experience with Godot but I never touch 3D once in my life. Everything was new. Hope you gonna enjoy this small

5 to 10 minutes games

The default keybinding is

- WASD to move

- Space to jump

- Shift to sprint

- C to crouch (you don't need it, even if a code a slide behavior, I didn't have time to implement mecanic that use it)

- Escape to pause

You can remap all of this in the settings menu Enjoy!  Levrault
